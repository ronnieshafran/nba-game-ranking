## NBAGameRanking

**This project is hosted at http://www.nbagameranking.com**

You wake up early in the morning. You have time to watch a game or two before you have to go to work.

You grab a cup of coffee, sit in front of your screen and start browsing tonights games. How will you decide which game you should watch?

Well, that's what this app is for: todays games are sorted, either by highest scoring game or closest one, in a SPOILER-FREE table.

This way, you know you're guaranteed to watch a good game! (or at least one with a lot of buckets...)
